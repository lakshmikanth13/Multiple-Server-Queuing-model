# Multiple-Server-Queuing-model

This project is aimed to develop content in Covid-19 category. The impact of the covid -19 
pandemic is drastically on people. More than ever the need for personal healthcare and 
hygienic life is gaining more importance. Increasing problems related to health in this digital 
era.

The recent Pandemic situation which resulted with spreading corona due to social 
gatherings, long queue at heavy populated areas are one of the main reasons for global 
pandemic.

Recently I went for a covid test at a nearby community health care center and I had to wait 
for 50 min in the queue in an enclosed hall before the sample was collected for the test. 
Being a victim to this situation and resulted with Covid +ve. I tried to understand the 
situation and wanted to model a multiple server queuing system and observe the queue 
with respect to time. And also to find, when would it be applicable for me/anyone to go for 
the test again and at which time it would be faster?
